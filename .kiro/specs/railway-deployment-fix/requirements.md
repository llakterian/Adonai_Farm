# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical deployment issues preventing the Adonai Farm Management System from running successfully on Railway. The system builds successfully but fails during runtime due to database connection and configuration issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to deploy successfully on Railway, so that the farm management system is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Railway THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN the application starts on Railway THEN the PostgreSQL database connection SHALL be established successfully
3. WHEN the database migration runs THEN all required tables SHALL be created in PostgreSQL
4. WHEN a user accesses the deployed application THEN the frontend SHALL load correctly
5. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return a successful status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database adapter to work correctly with PostgreSQL, so that all database operations function properly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SQL queries are executed THEN SQLite placeholders SHALL be converted to PostgreSQL format ($1, $2, etc.)
2. WHEN the migration script runs THEN it SHALL handle async operations correctly
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL work with both SQLite (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
4. WHEN the default admin user is created THEN it SHALL be accessible for login

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging, so that deployment issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connection fails THEN the error SHALL be logged with detailed information
2. WHEN migration fails THEN the process SHALL exit with appropriate error codes
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log the database type being used (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN appropriate fallback values SHALL be used
